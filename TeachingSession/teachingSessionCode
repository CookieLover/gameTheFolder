#This is a var (variable). Variables are like boxes. They can contain many things
#There are many different types of variables. These are some of the important ones

#Integer can be any number
integer = 6

#Strings can be any character including numbers. "Example"
string = "Hello World"

#Lists can be thought of as a queue of items (elements)
lst = ["1", "hello", "apple"]

#An If is something that tests whether something is True or false using logical operators
#The expression 3 > 4 would get the result False

number = 5

#If the number is larger than 3, it will print True
if number < 3:
    print("True")
#If the statement above is false, than it will print False
else:
    print("False")

#Loops will repeatedly run code until a condition is met
#There are two types of loops. For loops are the most common
#A for loop will keep running until a condition is met

#The variable is set inside the for loop
#range(3) means that the variable i will start at 0 and continue while i < 3
#Every time the code is runs, it will increment i by 1
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello!", str(i))

#For loops can also perform an action for every element in a list

lst = ["Hello", "World", "!"]

#This loop will go through every element in a list and print it to the console one by one
for i in lst:
	print(i)
